we cant even tell mother and father,you know what i think it is,faulkner,faulkner
i think it s a surprise for mother and father and mr patterson both because mr patterson sent you some candy,do you remember when mr patterson sent you some candy last summer,faulkner,faulkner

mrs patterson came to the door and opened it and stood there,he stopped chopping and looked at me,faulkner,faulkner
mrs patterson came across the garden running,when i saw her eyes i began to cry,faulkner,faulkner
you idiot mrs patterson said i told him never to send you alone again,give it to me,faulkner,faulkner
mr patterson came fast with the hoc,mrs patterson leaned across the fence reaching her hand,faulkner,faulkner
she was trying to climb the fence,give it to me she said give it to me,faulkner,faulkner
mr patterson climbed the fence,he took the letter,faulkner,faulkner
mrs patterson s dress was caught on the fence,i saw her eyes again and i ran down the hill,faulkner,faulkner
luster said,we going down to the branch,faulkner,faulkner
they were washing down at the branch,one of them was singing,faulkner,faulkner
i could smell the clothes flapping and the smoke blowing across the branch,you stay down here,faulkner,faulkner
luster said,you aint got no business up yonder,faulkner,faulkner
them folks hit you sho,what he want to do,faulkner,faulkner
he dont know what he want to do,luster said,faulkner,faulkner
he think he want to go up yonder where they knocking that hall,you sit down here and play with your jimson weed,faulkner,faulkner
look at them chillen playing in the branch if you got to look at something,how come you cant behave yourself like folks,faulkner,faulkner
i sat down on the bank where they were washing and the smoke blowing blue,is you all seen anything of a quarter down here,faulkner,faulkner
luster said,what quarter,faulkner,faulkner
he s gone said johnson,the hell he is i told him,hemingway,hemingway
then he came out again and smashed the water white and i could see he was hooked in the side of the mouth,the stripes showed clear on him,hemingway,hemingway
he was a fine fish bright silver now barred with purple and as big around as a log,he s gone johnson said,hemingway,hemingway
the line was slack,reel on him i said,hemingway,hemingway
he s hooked good,put her ahead with all the machine i yelled to the nigger,hemingway,hemingway
then once twice he came out stiff as a post the whole length of him jumping straight toward us throwing the water high each time he landed,the line came taut and i saw he was headed inshore again and i could see he was turning,hemingway,hemingway
now he ll make his run i said,if he hooks up i ll chase him,hemingway,hemingway
keep your drag light,he started jumping in those long lopes and every splash would be like a speed boat in a sea,hemingway,hemingway
we went after him keeping him on the quarter once i d made the turn,i had the wheel and i kept yelling to johnson to keep his drag light and reel fast,hemingway,hemingway
all of a sudden i see his rod jerk and the line go slack,it wouldn t look slack unless you knew about it because of the pull of the belly of the line in the water,hemingway,hemingway
but i knew,he s gone i told him,hemingway,hemingway
the fish was still jumping and he went on jumping until he was out of sight,he was a fine fish all right,hemingway,hemingway
i can still feel him pull johnson said,he s still jumping you could see him out a half a mile still throwing spouts of water,hemingway,hemingway
i felt his drag,he had it screwed down tight,hemingway,hemingway
you couldn t pull out any line,it had to break,hemingway,hemingway
if you don t give them line when they hook up like that they break it,there isn t any line will hold them,hemingway,hemingway
when they want it you ve got to give it to them,you have to keep a light drag,hemingway,hemingway
the market fishermen can t hold them tight when they do that even with a harpoon line,what we have to do is use the boat to chase them so they don t take it all when they make their run,hemingway,hemingway
you have to reel that line in first i told him,we d hooked that fish and lost him without waking eddy up,hemingway,hemingway
now old eddy came back astern,what s the matter he said,hemingway,hemingway
eddy was a good man on a boat once before he got to be a rummy but he isn t any good now,i looked at him standing there tall and hollowcheeked with his mouth loose and that white stuff in the corners of his eyes and his hair all faded in the sun,hemingway,hemingway
i knew he woke up dead for a drink,you d better drink a bottle of beer i told him,hemingway,hemingway
he took one out of the box and drank it,well mr,hemingway,hemingway
johnson he said i guess i better finish my nap,much obliged for the beer sir some eddy,hemingway,hemingway
the fish didn t make any difference to him,well we hooked another one around noon and he jumped off,hemingway,hemingway
you could see the hook go thirty feet in the air when he threw it,what did i do wrong then johnson asked,hemingway,hemingway
nothing i said,johnson said eddy who d waked up to have another bottle of mr,hemingway,hemingway
johnson you re just unlucky,now maybe you re lucky with women,hemingway,hemingway
johnson what do you say we go out tonight then he went back and laid down again,about four o clock when we re coming back close in to shore against the stream it going like a mill race us with the sun at our backs the biggest black marlin i ever saw in my life hit johnson s bait,hemingway,hemingway
we d put out a feather squid and caught four of those little tuna and the nigger put one on his hook for bait,it trolled pretty heavy but it made a big splash in the wake,hemingway,hemingway
johnson took the harness off the reel so he could put the rod across his knees because his arms got tired holding it in position all the time,because his hands got tired holding the spool of the reel against the drag of the big bait he screwed the drag down when i wasn t looking,hemingway,hemingway
i never knew he had it down,i didn t like to see him hold the rod that way but i hated to be crabbing at him all the time,hemingway,hemingway
besides with the drag off line would go out so there wasn t any danger,but it was a sloppy way to fish,hemingway,hemingway
i was at the wheel and was working the edge of the stream opposite that old cement factory where it makes deep so close in to shore and where it makes a sort of eddy where there is always lots of bait,then i saw a splash like a depth bomb and the sword and eye and open lowerjaw and huge purpleblack head of a black marlin,hemingway,hemingway
the whole top fin was up out of water looking as high as a fullrigged ship and the whole scythe tail was out as he smashed at that tuna,the bill was as big around as a baseball bat and slanted up and as he grabbed the bait he sliced the ocean wide open,hemingway,hemingway
he was solid purpleblack and he had an eye as big as a soup bowl,he was huge,hemingway,hemingway
i bet he d go a thousand pounds,i yelled to johnson to let him have line but before i could say a word i saw johnson rise up in the air off the chair as though he was being derricked and him holding just for a second onto that rod and the rod bending like a bow and then the butt caught him in the belly and the whole works went overboard,hemingway,hemingway
he d screwed the drag tight and when the fish struck it lifted johnson right out of the chair and he couldn t hold it,he d had the butt under one leg and the rod across his lap,hemingway,hemingway
if he d had the harness on it would have taken him along too,i cut out the engine and went back to the stern,hemingway,hemingway
he was sitting there holding onto his belly where the rod butt had hit him,i guess that s enough for today i said,hemingway,hemingway
what was it he said to me,black marlin i said,hemingway,hemingway
the reel cost two hundred and fifty dollars,it costs more now,hemingway,hemingway
the rod cost me fortyfive,johnson he says you re just unlucky,hemingway,hemingway
i tell you mr,that s what you wanted to fight all by yourself i told him,hemingway,hemingway
i was plenty sore,they re too big johnson said,hemingway,hemingway
still fishing,he swallowed the bait and they pulled his stomach out and he came to the top and died,hemingway,hemingway
johnson eddy said,if it isn t enjoyable why do it,hemingway,hemingway
listen mr,you hit the nail on the head there,hemingway,hemingway
i told the nigger to head her for the morro,i didn t say anything to them and there they sat eddy in one of the chairs with a bottle of beer and johnson with another,hemingway,hemingway
i was thinking to myself that this johnson had fished fifteen days finally he hooks into a fish a fisherman would give a year to tie into he loses him he loses my heavy tackle he makes a fool of himself and he sits there perfectly content drinking with a rummy,what s this for the nigger asks me showing the coins,hemingway,hemingway
a tip i told him in spanish,you re through,hemingway,hemingway
he was a nigger that never thought much of any of us,when do you want to settle up mr,hemingway,hemingway
johnson i asked him,i ll go to the bank in the morning johnson said,hemingway,hemingway
there s sixteen with today and a day each way makes eighteen,if a fish broke it and it wasn t your fault that would be something else,hemingway,hemingway
that s pretty good mr,johnson eddy said,hemingway,hemingway
you see it don t you cap,if he was in it he d be killed,hemingway,hemingway
so he wouldn t have to pay,you owe two hundred and ninetyfive dollars for that rod and reel and line i told johnson,hemingway,hemingway
well it s not right he said,i m not charging you for the line,hemingway,hemingway
a fish like that could get all your line and it not be your fault,if there was any one here but a rummy they d tell you how square i m being with you,hemingway,hemingway
i know it seems like a lot of money but it was a lot of money when i bought the tackle too,johnson he says i m a rummy,hemingway,hemingway
maybe i am,but i tell you he s right,hemingway,hemingway
he s right and he s reasonable eddy told him,i don t want to make any difficulties johnson said finally,hemingway,hemingway
i ll pay for it even though i don t see it,i ll give you a list of what i spent and i ll deduct what grub there is left,hemingway,hemingway
listen mr,johnson eddy said,hemingway,hemingway
if you knew the way they usually charge a stranger you d know it was more than reasonable,do you know what it is,hemingway,hemingway
it s exceptional,so the three of us sat there in the stern and drank a highball together,hemingway,hemingway
the next day i worked around her all morning changing the oil in her base and one thing and another,at noon i went uptown and ate at a chink place where you get a good meal for forty cents and then i bought some things to take home to my wife and our three girls,hemingway,hemingway
you know perfume a couple of fans and three of those high combs,when i finished i stopped in at donovan s and had a beer and talked with the old man and then walked back to the san francisco docks stopping in at three or four places for a beer on the way,hemingway,hemingway
i bought frankie a couple at the cunard bar and i came on board feeling pretty good,when i came on board i had just forty cents left,hemingway,hemingway
frankie came on board with me and while we sat and waited for johnson i drank a couple of cold ones out of the ice box with frankie,eddy hadn t shown up all night or all day but i knew he would be around sooner or later as soon as his credit ran out,hemingway,hemingway
donovan told me he d been in there the night before a little while with johnson and eddy had been setting them up on credit,we waited and i began to wonder about johnson not showing up,hemingway,hemingway
i d left word at the dock for them to tell him to go on board and wait for me but they said he hadn t come,still i figured he had been out late and probably didn t get up till around noon,hemingway,hemingway
the banks were open until threethirty,we saw the plane go out and about fivethirty i was all over feeling good and was getting plenty worried,hemingway,hemingway
at six o clock i sent frankie up to the hotel to see if johnson was there,i still thought he might be out on a time or he might be there at the hotel feeling too bad to get up,hemingway,hemingway
i kept waiting and waiting until it was late,but i was getting plenty worried because he owed me eight hundred and twentyfive dollars,hemingway,hemingway
the one i had here this morning,frankie was gone about a little over half an hour,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,when i saw him coming he was walking fast and shaking his head,faulkner,hemingway
i lost it somewhere,he went on the plane he said,faulkner,hemingway
it fell through this here hole in my pocket,all right,faulkner,hemingway
if i dont find it i cant go to the show tonight,there it was,faulkner,hemingway
where d you get a quarter boy,the consulate was closed,faulkner,hemingway

luster said plenty more where that one come ftom,some mr,faulkner,hemingway
only i got to find that one,johnson all right,faulkner,hemingway

i aint studying no quarter,i should have known better,faulkner,hemingway
i got my own business to tend to,well i said to frankie we might as well have a cold one,faulkner,hemingway
come on here,johnson bought them there were three bottles of tropical left,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,frankie felt as bad as i did,faulkner,hemingway
help me look for it,i don t know how he could but he seemed to,faulkner,hemingway
he would nt know a quarter if he was to see it would he,he just kept slapping me on the back and shaking his head,faulkner,hemingway
he can help look just the same,so there it was,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,i was broke,faulkner,hemingway
you all going to the show tonight,i d lost five hundred and thirty dollars of the charter and tackle i couldn t replace for three hundred and fifty more,faulkner,hemingway
dont talk to me about no show,how some of that gang that hangs around the dock would be pleased at that i thought,faulkner,hemingway
time i get done over this here tub i be too tired to lift my hand to do nothing,it certainly would make some conchs happy,faulkner,hemingway
i bet you be there,and the day before i turned down three thousand dollars to land three aliens on the keys,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,anywhere just to get them out of the country,faulkner,hemingway
i bet you was there last night,all right what was i going to do now,faulkner,hemingway
i bet you all be right there when that tent open,i couldn t bring in a load because you have to have money to buy the booze and besides there s no money in it any more,faulkner,hemingway
be enough niggers there without me,the town is flooded with it and there s nobody to buy it,faulkner,hemingway
was last night,but i was damned if i was going home broke and starve a summer in that town,faulkner,hemingway
nigger s money good as white folks i reckon,besides i ve got a family,faulkner,hemingway
white folks gives nigger money because know first white man comes along with a band going to get it all back so nigger can go to work for some more,the clearance was paid when we came in,faulkner,hemingway
aint nobody going make you go to that show,you usually pay the broker in advance and he enters you and clears you,faulkner,hemingway
aint yet,hell i didn t even have enough money to put in gas,faulkner,hemingway
aint thought of it i reckon,it was a hell of a note all right,faulkner,hemingway
what you got against white folks,some mr,faulkner,hemingway
aint got nothing against them,i ve got to carry something frankie i said,faulkner,hemingway
i goes my way and lets white folks go theirs,he hangs around the water front and does odd jobs and is pretty deaf and drinks too much every night,faulkner,hemingway
i aint studying that show,but you never saw a fellow more loyal nor with a better heart,faulkner,hemingway
got a man in it can play a tune on a saw,i ve known him since i first started to run over there,faulkner,hemingway
play it like a banjo,he used to help me load plenty of times,faulkner,hemingway
you go last night,then when i quit handling stuff and went partyboating and broke out this swordfishing in cuba i used to see him a lot around the dock and around the café,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,he seems dumb and he usually smiles instead of talking but that s because he s deaf,faulkner,hemingway
i going tonight if i can find where i lost that quarter,you carry anything frankie asked,faulkner,hemingway

luster said,everything on the menu is a dime except soup and that is a nickel,faulkner,hemingway
you reckon i be found anywhere with him time he start bellering,i walked as far as there with frankie and i went in and he went on,faulkner,hemingway

i bet you better not let your grandmammy hear you talking like that,there were a lot of gallegos drinking at the bar and some eating,faulkner,hemingway
luster got into the branch where they were playing,one table was playing dominoes already,faulkner,hemingway
he hunted in the water along the bank,i had black bean soup and a beef stew with boiled potatoes for fifteen cents,faulkner,hemingway
i had it when we was down here this morning,a bottle of hatuey beer brought it up to a quarter,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,when i spoke to the waiter about the shooting he wouldn t say anything,faulkner,hemingway
where bouts you lose it,they were all plenty scared,faulkner,hemingway
right out this here hole in my pocket,i finished the meal and sat back and smoked a cigarette and worried my head off,faulkner,hemingway
luster said,then i saw frankie coming in the door with some one behind him,faulkner,hemingway
they hunted in the branch,yellow stuff i thought to myself,faulkner,hemingway
then they all stood up quick and stopped then they splashed and fought in the branch,so it s yellow stuff,faulkner,hemingway
luster got it and they squatted in the water looking up the hill through the bushes,this is mr,faulkner,hemingway
