then those on one side stopped at the tall white post where the soldier was,but on the other side they went on smooth and steady but a little slower,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1

hum up queenie,the shapes flowed on,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
the ones on thc other side began again bright and fast and smooth like when caddy says we are going to sleep,aint you shamed,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
we went through the barn,the stalls were all open,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
you aint got no spotted pony to ride now luster said,the floor was dry and dusty,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
the roof was falling,the slanting holes were full of spinning yellow,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
what do you want to go that way for,you want to get your head knocked off with one of them balls,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
caddy said,or they ll be froze,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
you dont want your hands froze on christmas do you,we went around the barn,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
the big cow and the little one were standing in the door and we could hear prince and queenie and fancy stomping inside the barn,if it was nt so cold we d ride fancy,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
caddy said,but it s too cold to hold on today,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
then we could seethe branch where the smoke was blowing,that s where they are killing the pig,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
caddy said,we can come back by there and see them,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
we went down the hill,you want to carry the letter,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
caddy said,you can carry it,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
she took the letter out of her pocket and put it in mine,it s a christmas present,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
caddy said,uncle maury is going to surprise mrs patterson with it,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
we got to give it to her without letting anybody see it,keep your hands in your pockets good now,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
we came to the branch,it s froze,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
caddy said,she broke the top of the water and held a piece of it against my face,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
that means how cold it is,she helped me across and we went up the hill,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
we cant even tell mother and father,you know what i think it is,prediction\faulkner,prediction\faulkner,1
he s gone said johnson,the hell he is i told him,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
then he came out again and smashed the water white and i could see he was hooked in the side of the mouth,the stripes showed clear on him,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
he was a fine fish bright silver now barred with purple and as big around as a log,he s gone johnson said,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the line was slack,reel on him i said,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
he s hooked good,put her ahead with all the machine i yelled to the nigger,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
then once twice he came out stiff as a post the whole length of him jumping straight toward us throwing the water high each time he landed,the line came taut and i saw he was headed inshore again and i could see he was turning,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
now he ll make his run i said,if he hooks up i ll chase him,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
keep your drag light,he started jumping in those long lopes and every splash would be like a speed boat in a sea,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
we went after him keeping him on the quarter once i d made the turn,i had the wheel and i kept yelling to johnson to keep his drag light and reel fast,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
all of a sudden i see his rod jerk and the line go slack,it wouldn t look slack unless you knew about it because of the pull of the belly of the line in the water,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
but i knew,he s gone i told him,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the fish was still jumping and he went on jumping until he was out of sight,he was a fine fish all right,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i can still feel him pull johnson said,he s still jumping you could see him out a half a mile still throwing spouts of water,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i felt his drag,he had it screwed down tight,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
you couldn t pull out any line,it had to break,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
if you don t give them line when they hook up like that they break it,there isn t any line will hold them,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
when they want it you ve got to give it to them,you have to keep a light drag,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the market fishermen can t hold them tight when they do that even with a harpoon line,what we have to do is use the boat to chase them so they don t take it all when they make their run,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
you have to reel that line in first i told him,we d hooked that fish and lost him without waking eddy up,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
now old eddy came back astern,what s the matter he said,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
eddy was a good man on a boat once before he got to be a rummy but he isn t any good now,i looked at him standing there tall and hollowcheeked with his mouth loose and that white stuff in the corners of his eyes and his hair all faded in the sun,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i knew he woke up dead for a drink,you d better drink a bottle of beer i told him,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
he took one out of the box and drank it,well mr,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
johnson he said i guess i better finish my nap,much obliged for the beer sir some eddy,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the fish didn t make any difference to him,well we hooked another one around noon and he jumped off,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
you could see the hook go thirty feet in the air when he threw it,what did i do wrong then johnson asked,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
nothing i said,johnson said eddy who d waked up to have another bottle of mr,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
johnson you re just unlucky,now maybe you re lucky with women,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
johnson what do you say we go out tonight then he went back and laid down again,about four o clock when we re coming back close in to shore against the stream it going like a mill race us with the sun at our backs the biggest black marlin i ever saw in my life hit johnson s bait,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
we d put out a feather squid and caught four of those little tuna and the nigger put one on his hook for bait,it trolled pretty heavy but it made a big splash in the wake,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
johnson took the harness off the reel so he could put the rod across his knees because his arms got tired holding it in position all the time,because his hands got tired holding the spool of the reel against the drag of the big bait he screwed the drag down when i wasn t looking,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i never knew he had it down,i didn t like to see him hold the rod that way but i hated to be crabbing at him all the time,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
besides with the drag off line would go out so there wasn t any danger,but it was a sloppy way to fish,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i was at the wheel and was working the edge of the stream opposite that old cement factory where it makes deep so close in to shore and where it makes a sort of eddy where there is always lots of bait,then i saw a splash like a depth bomb and the sword and eye and open lowerjaw and huge purpleblack head of a black marlin,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the whole top fin was up out of water looking as high as a fullrigged ship and the whole scythe tail was out as he smashed at that tuna,the bill was as big around as a baseball bat and slanted up and as he grabbed the bait he sliced the ocean wide open,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
he was solid purpleblack and he had an eye as big as a soup bowl,he was huge,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i bet he d go a thousand pounds,i yelled to johnson to let him have line but before i could say a word i saw johnson rise up in the air off the chair as though he was being derricked and him holding just for a second onto that rod and the rod bending like a bow and then the butt caught him in the belly and the whole works went overboard,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
he d screwed the drag tight and when the fish struck it lifted johnson right out of the chair and he couldn t hold it,he d had the butt under one leg and the rod across his lap,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
if he d had the harness on it would have taken him along too,i cut out the engine and went back to the stern,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
he was sitting there holding onto his belly where the rod butt had hit him,i guess that s enough for today i said,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
what was it he said to me,black marlin i said,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the reel cost two hundred and fifty dollars,it costs more now,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
the rod cost me fortyfive,johnson he says you re just unlucky,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i tell you mr,that s what you wanted to fight all by yourself i told him,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i was plenty sore,they re too big johnson said,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
still fishing,he swallowed the bait and they pulled his stomach out and he came to the top and died,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
johnson eddy said,if it isn t enjoyable why do it,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
listen mr,you hit the nail on the head there,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i told the nigger to head her for the morro,i didn t say anything to them and there they sat eddy in one of the chairs with a bottle of beer and johnson with another,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
i was thinking to myself that this johnson had fished fifteen days finally he hooks into a fish a fisherman would give a year to tie into he loses him he loses my heavy tackle he makes a fool of himself and he sits there perfectly content drinking with a rummy,what s this for the nigger asks me showing the coins,prediction\hemingway,prediction\hemingway,1
almost as stirring as when she crawled to him across the length of her parents living room that night her eyes leveled on his exposed member and her tongue out and moving,i want to be your whore she whispered to him without prompting too while on the back terrace her mother told his mother how adorable sharon looked in the winter coat they d bought for her that afternoon,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
it was not it turned out a complicated sort of rebellion sharon was engaged in but then she wasn t a complicated girl,if her behavior continued to exceed understanding it was now because it seemed so pathetically transparent,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
sharon hated her father,one reason she hated she because of that ugly name of theirs which he refused to do anything about,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
years and years ago when she was still an infant in the crib all five brothers on the shatzky side had gotten together to decide to change the family name for business reasons they had decided on shadley,only her father of the five refused to make the improvement,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
i ain t ashamed he told the other went on from there he informed his daughter to become the biggest success of them all,as if sharon protested to zuckerman that proved anything,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
what about the sheer ugliness of that name,what about the way it sounded to people,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
especially for a girl,her cousin cindy was cindy shadley her cousin ruthie was ruthie alone of the girls in the family was still shatzky,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
come on will you m a trademark her father told her i m known nationwide,what am i supposed to become all of a sudden al the zipper king shadley,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
who s he honey well the truth was that by the time she was fifteen she couldn t bear that he called himself the zipper king either,the zipper king was as awful as ways it was worse,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
she wanted a father with a name that wasn t either a joke or an outright lie she wanted a real name and she warned him some day when she was old enough she would hire a lawyer and go down to the county courthouse and get one,you ll get one all you know how,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
the way all the other nice girls do,you ll get married and why i ll cry at the wedding is out of happiness that i won t have to hear any more of this name and so on in this vein for the five tedious years of sharon s adolescence,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
which wasn t quite over yet,what is shatzky she cried sorrowfully to zuckerman but the past tense of shitzky,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
oh why won t he change it,the truth was that when she was not putting on a threering circus for him sharon was pretty much of a bore to zuckerman,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
she didn t know anything about anything,she did not pronounce the g in length nor did she aspirate the h in when or why nor would she have in whale had the conversation ever turned to melville,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
and she had the most cockney philadelphia o he had ever heard on anyone other than a cabdriver,if and when she did get a joke of his she would sigh and roll her eyes toward heaven as though his subtleties were on a par with her father who had been the h l mencken of bass college,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
whose editorials on the shortcomings of the administration and the student body miss benson had likened in their savage wit to jonathan swift,how could he ever take sharon up to bass with him to visit miss benson,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
what if she started telling miss benson those pointless and interminable anecdotes about herself and her highschool friends,oh when she started talking she could bury you in boredom,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
rarely in conversation did sharon finish a sentence but rather to zuckerman s disgust glued her words together by a gummy mixture of you knows and i means and with such expressions of enthusiasm as really great really terrific and really neat last usually to describe the gang of kids she had traveled with at atlantic city when she was fifteen which to be sure had only been the summer before last,coarse childish ignorant utterly lacking in that exquisiteness of feeling and refinement of spirit that he had come to admire so in the the virginia woolf whose photograph had been tacked above his desk during his last semester at bass,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
he entered the army after their feverish daredevil month together secretly relieved at having left behind him seemingly as he had found her al and minna s fivefoot nineinch baby girl she was a tantalizing slave and an extraordinary lay but hardly a soul mate for someone who felt as he did about great writers and great books,or so it seemed until that day they issued him his mi rifle and he found he needed everyone he had,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
i love your prick the girl wept into the phone,i miss your prick so much,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
oh nathan i m touching my cunt i m touching my cunt and making believe it s you,oh nathan should i make myself come on the phone,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
oh what if just the genitals went and he lived a land mine were to explode beneath his boots and he was returned to a girl like sharon shatzky a blank between the legs,no he told himself,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
stop having such thoughts,lay off,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
use your brains,that is only irrational guilt over sharon and the zucchini is only fear of punishment for buggering the daughter right under the father s nose,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
casebook fantasies of retribution,no such thing can happen to him was what he meant because of course in warfare such things do happen they happen every day,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
and then after the eight weeks of infantry training followed by eight more at mp school he was assigned as a clerktypist to a quartermaster unit at fort campbell in the southwestern corner of kentucky sixty miles east of paducah eight thousand east of the land mines,lucky zuckerman,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
beneficiary of one of those administrative errors by which doomed men are suddenly pardoned and the happygolucky are overnight earmarked for death,these things also happen every day,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
zuckerman could type only with his index fingers and he knew nothing about filing or making out forms but fortunately for him the captain in charge of the supply room to which he was assigned was so pleased to have a jew around to that too has been known to he was willing to make do with an inept assistant,he did the inept assistant continuously feared he the error in classification that had sent zuckerman to fort campbell instead of to his bloody demise in the mud behind a brothel in seoul nor did he request a replacement for him from personnel,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
instead each afternoon before departing for the links over by the air base captain clark would tune up for his game by driving cotton golf balls out of his office in the direction of the cubicle occupied by the clerktypist manqué,zuckerman did his best to look unperturbed when the golf balls glanced off his shirt,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
on target sir said he with a smile,not kwat replied his superior all concentration not and would continue to swat them out through the open door of his office until at last he d found the mark,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
southern bigot,zuckerman left the supply room at the end of each day bound for the office of the adjutant general where he intended to bring charges against captain clark who for all he knew held secret membership in the kkk,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
but since actually zuckerman was not even supposed to be in kentucky but had been allocated for destruction in korea and might wind up there yet if he gave clark any trouble he invariably saw fit to suppress his indignation and proceed on over to the mess hall for dinner and then on to the post library to continue to read his way through the bloomsbury group with time out every hour or so for another look at the day s bawdy letter from the teenage debauchee he hadn t been able to bring himself to relinquish quite yet,but oh christ was he mad,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
his human dignity,his human rights,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
his religion,oh each time a golf ball caromed softly off his flesh how he seethed with isn t however as private zuckerman well knew the same as running with blood,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
nor is it what is meant in literature or even in life for that matter by suffering or pain,though pain would come to zuckerman in the form of estrangement mortification fierce and unremitting opposition antagonists who were not respectable deans or loving fathers or dimwitted officers in the army quartermaster corps oh yes pain would enter his life soon enough and not entirely without invitation,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
as the loving father had warned him looking for trouble he would find what a surprise that would be,for in severity and duration in sheer painfulness it would be like nothing he had known at home in school or in the service nor would it be like anything he had imagined while contemplating the harrowed soulful face of virginia woolf or while writing his a honors paper on the undercurrent of agony in her novels,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
only a short time after having been shipped by providential last big dose as it turned out of beginner s the rural american southland instead of the korean slaughter adversity was to catch up with the young conquistador,he would begin to the vanity and the ignorance to be sure but above all for the contradictions the stinging tongue and the tender hide the spiritual aspirations and the lewd desires the softy boyish needs and the manly the magisterial ambitions,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
yes over the next decade of his life he was to learn all that his father might have wished dale carnegie to teach him about humility and then some,and then some more,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
but that is another story and one whose luridness makes the smalltime southern jewbaiter lofting cotton golf balls toward his nose makes even seventeenyearold sharon shatzky performing for him on a gourd like a pigalle whore at an exhibition seem as much a part of his idyllic and innocent youth as that afternoon he once spent sipping tea and eating watercress in caroline benson s garden,the story of zuckerman s suffering calls for an approach far more serious than that which seems appropriate to the tale of his easeful salad days,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
to narrate with fidelity the misfortunes of zuckerman s twenties would require deeper dredging a darker sense of irony a grave and pensive voice to replace the amused olympian point of maybe what that story requires is neither gravity nor complexity but just another author someone who would see it too for the simple fivethousandword comedy that it very well may have been,unfortunately the author of this story having himself experienced a similar misfortune at about the same age does not have it in him even yet midway through his thirties to tell it briefly or to find it funny,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
unfortunate because he wonders if that isn t more the measure of the man than of the misfortune,it was not for fear of loneliness that i chose my wife or to have a helpmate or a cook or a companion in my old age and it certainly was not out of lust,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
no matter what they may say about me now sexual desire had nothing to do with it,to the contrary though she was a pretty enough womansquare strong nordic head resolute blue eyes that i thought of admiringly as wintry straight wheatcolored hair worn in bangs a handsome smile an appealing openhearted short heavylegged body struck me as very nearly dwarfish in its proportions and was from first to last unremittingly distasteful,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
her gait in particular displeased me mannish awkward it took on a kind of rolling quality when she tried to move quickly and in my mind associated with images of cowhands and merchant seamen,watching her run to meet me on some chicago we had become would positively recoil even at a distance at the prospect of holding that body against me at the idea that voluntarily i had made her mine,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
lydia ketterer was a divorced woman five years my senior and mother of a tenyearold girl who lived with lydia s former husband and his second wife in a new suburban housing development south of chicago,during their marriage whenever lydia dared to criticize or question her husband s judgment he would lift her from the massive man twice her weight and a foot heave her against the nearest wall in the months following the divorce he abused her through her child who was then six and in lydia s custody and when lydia broke down ketterer took the child to live with him and subsequently after lydia had been released from the hospital and was back in her apartment refused to return the little girl,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
he was the second man nearly to destroy her the first lydia s father had seduced her when she was twelve,the mother had been bedridden since lydia s birth a victim it would seem of nothing more than lumbago but perpetually weak unto dying,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
after the father fled lydia had been taken to be raised in the home of two spinster aunts in skokie until she ran off with ketterer at the age of eighteen she and her mother shared a room at the rear of this haven whose heroes were the aviator lindbergh the senator bilbo the cleric coughlin and the patriot gerald l k smith,it had been a life of little but punishment humiliation betrayal and defeat and it was to this that i was drawn against all my misgivings,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
of course the contrast to my own background of familial devotion and solidarity was overwhelming whereas lydia remembered a thousand and one nights of rubbing sloan s liniment into her mother s back i could not remember a single hour of my childhood when my mother was incapable of performing the rites of her office,if indeed she ever had been indisposed it seemed not even to interfere with her famous whistling that continuous medley of show tunes she chirped melodiously away at through her day of housework and family chores,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
the sickly one in our home was me suffocating diphtheria subsequent annual respiratory infections debilitating glandular fevers mysterious visitations of allergies until puberty i spent as much time at home in my bed or under a blanket on a sofa in the living room as i did in my seat in the classroom all of which makes the disposition of my mother the mrs,zuckerbird the postman called more impressive,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
my father though not so sunny in his indestructibility and constitutionally a much more solemn person than my peppy peasant of a mother was no less equal to the hardships our family endured specifically the depression my ailments and my older sister soma s inexplicable marriages twice to the sons of sicilians the first an embezzler and in the end a suicide the second honest in his business but otherwise common as dirt the yiddish word which alone seemed to carry the weight of our heartbreak and contempt prust,we ourselves were not elegant but surely we were not coarse,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
dignity i was to understand had nothing to do with one s social station character conduct was everything,my mother used to laugh and make cracks about the ladies around who had secret dreams of mink coats and miami beach vacations,prediction\roth,prediction\roth,1
i think it s a surprise for mother and father and mr patterson both because mr patterson sent you some candy,a tip i told him in spanish,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
do you remember when mr patterson sent you some candy last summer,you re through,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
there was a fence,he was a nigger that never thought much of any of us,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
the vine was dry and the wind rattled in it,when do you want to settle up mr,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
only i dont see why uncle maury did nt send versh,johnson i asked him,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
caddy said,i ll go to the bank in the morning johnson said,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
versh wont tell,there s sixteen with today and a day each way makes eighteen,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mrs patterson was looking out the window,if a fish broke it and it wasn t your fault that would be something else,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
you wait here,that s pretty good mr,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
caddy said,johnson eddy said,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
wait right here now,you see it don t you cap,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
i ll be back in a minute,if he was in it he d be killed,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
give me the letter,so he wouldn t have to pay,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
she took the letter out of my pocket,you owe two hundred and ninetyfive dollars for that rod and reel and line i told johnson,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
keep your hands in your pockets,well it s not right he said,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
she climbed the fence with the letter in her hand and went through the brown rattling flowers,i m not charging you for the line,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mrs patterson came to the door and opened it and stood there,a fish like that could get all your line and it not be your fault,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
he stopped chopping and looked at me,if there was any one here but a rummy they d tell you how square i m being with you,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mrs patterson came across the garden running,i know it seems like a lot of money but it was a lot of money when i bought the tackle too,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
when i saw her eyes i began to cry,johnson he says i m a rummy,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
you idiot mrs patterson said i told him never to send you alone again,maybe i am,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
give it to me,but i tell you he s right,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mr patterson came fast with the hoc,he s right and he s reasonable eddy told him,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mrs patterson leaned across the fence reaching her hand,i don t want to make any difficulties johnson said finally,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
she was trying to climb the fence,i ll pay for it even though i don t see it,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
give it to me she said give it to me,i ll give you a list of what i spent and i ll deduct what grub there is left,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mr patterson climbed the fence,listen mr,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
he took the letter,johnson eddy said,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
mrs patterson s dress was caught on the fence,if you knew the way they usually charge a stranger you d know it was more than reasonable,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
i saw her eyes again and i ran down the hill,do you know what it is,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
luster said,it s exceptional,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
we going down to the branch,so the three of us sat there in the stern and drank a highball together,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
they were washing down at the branch,the next day i worked around her all morning changing the oil in her base and one thing and another,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
one of them was singing,at noon i went uptown and ate at a chink place where you get a good meal for forty cents and then i bought some things to take home to my wife and our three girls,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
i could smell the clothes flapping and the smoke blowing across the branch,you know perfume a couple of fans and three of those high combs,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
you stay down here,when i finished i stopped in at donovan s and had a beer and talked with the old man and then walked back to the san francisco docks stopping in at three or four places for a beer on the way,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
luster said,i bought frankie a couple at the cunard bar and i came on board feeling pretty good,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
you aint got no business up yonder,when i came on board i had just forty cents left,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
them folks hit you sho,frankie came on board with me and while we sat and waited for johnson i drank a couple of cold ones out of the ice box with frankie,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
what he want to do,eddy hadn t shown up all night or all day but i knew he would be around sooner or later as soon as his credit ran out,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
he dont know what he want to do,donovan told me he d been in there the night before a little while with johnson and eddy had been setting them up on credit,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
luster said,we waited and i began to wonder about johnson not showing up,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
he think he want to go up yonder where they knocking that hall,i d left word at the dock for them to tell him to go on board and wait for me but they said he hadn t come,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
you sit down here and play with your jimson weed,still i figured he had been out late and probably didn t get up till around noon,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
look at them chillen playing in the branch if you got to look at something,the banks were open until threethirty,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
how come you cant behave yourself like folks,we saw the plane go out and about fivethirty i was all over feeling good and was getting plenty worried,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
i sat down on the bank where they were washing and the smoke blowing blue,at six o clock i sent frankie up to the hotel to see if johnson was there,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
is you all seen anything of a quarter down here,i still thought he might be out on a time or he might be there at the hotel feeling too bad to get up,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
luster said,i kept waiting and waiting until it was late,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
what quarter,but i was getting plenty worried because he owed me eight hundred and twentyfive dollars,prediction\faulkner,prediction\hemingway,0
the one i had here this morning,to her she would say disparagingly of some silly neighbor the beall and endall is to put on a silver fox and go gallivanting with the hoi polloi not until i got to college and misused the word myself did i learn that what my mother took to mean the because hoi polloi sounded like another of her disdainful expressions for people who put on airs the hoitytoity referred to the masses,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,so much for the class struggle as a burning issue in my house or social resentment or ambitiousness as a motive for action,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i lost it somewhere,a strong character not a big bankroll was to them the evidence of one s worth,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
it fell through this here hole in my pocket,good sensible people,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
if i dont find it i cant go to the show tonight,why their two offspring should have wasted themselves as they did why both children should have wed themselves to disaster is difficult to understand,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
where d you get a quarter boy,that my sister s first husband and my only wife should both have taken their own lives would seem to suggest something about our common upbringing,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
find it in white folks pocket while they aint looking,but what,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
got it at the getting place,i have no theories,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said plenty more where that one come ftom,if ever a mother and father were not responsible for the foolishness of their children it was mine,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
only i got to find that one,my father was a bookkeeper,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
is you all found it yet,because of his excellent memory and his quickness with figures he was considered the local savant in our neighborhood of hardworking firstgeneration jews and was the man most frequently consulted by people in trouble,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i aint studying no quarter,a thin austere and humorless person always meticulous in a white shirt and a tie he communicated his love for me in a precise colorless fashion that makes me ache with tenderness for him especially now that he is the bedridden one and i live in selfexile thousands of miles from his bed,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i got my own business to tend to,when i was the sickly feverish patient i felt something more like mystification as though he were a kind of talking electrical toy come to play with me promptly each evening at six,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
come on here,his idea of amusing me was to teach me to solve the sort of arithmetical puzzles at which he himself was a whiz,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,marking down he would say not unlike a recitation student announcing the tide of a poem,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
help me look for it,a clothing dealer trying to dispose of an overcoat cut in last year s style marked it down from its original price of thirty dollars to twentyfour,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
he would nt know a quarter if he was to see it would he,failing to make a sale he reduced the price still further to nineteen dollars and twenty cents,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
he can help look just the same,again he found no takers so he tried another price reduction and this time sold it here he would pause if i wished i might ask him to repeat any or all of the details,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,if not he proceeded,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
you all going to the show tonight,all right nathan what was the selling price if the last markdown was consistent with the others or making a chain a lumberjack has six sections of chain each consisting of four links,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
dont talk to me about no show,if the cost of cutting open a and so on,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
time i get done over this here tub i be too tired to lift my hand to do nothing,the next day while my mother whistled gershwin and laundered my father s shirts i would daydream in my bed about the clothing dealer and the lumberjack,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i bet you be there,to whom had the haberdasher finally sold the overcoat,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,did the man who bought it realize it was cut in last year s style,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i bet you was there last night,if he wore it to a restaurant would people laugh,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i bet you all be right there when that tent open,and what did last year s style look like anyway,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
be enough niggers there without me,again he found no takers i would say aloud finding much to feel melancholy about in that idea,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
was last night,i still remember how charged for me was that word takers could it have been the lumberjack with the six sections of chain who in his rustic innocence had bought the overcoat cut in last year s style,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
nigger s money good as white folks i reckon,and why suddenly did he need an overcoat,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
white folks gives nigger money because know first white man comes along with a band going to get it all back so nigger can go to work for some more,invited to a fancy ball,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
aint nobody going make you go to that show,by whom,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
aint yet,my mother thought the questions i raised about these puzzles were cute and was glad they gave me something to think about when she was occupied with housework and could not take the time to play go fish or checkers my father on the other hand was disheartened to find me intrigued by fantastic and irrelevant details of geography and personality and intention instead of the simple beauty of the arithmetical solution,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
aint thought of it i reckon,he did not think that was intelligent of me and he was right,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
what you got against white folks,i have no nostalgia for that childhood of illness none at all,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
aint got nothing against them,in early adolescence i underwent daily schoolyard humiliation at the time it seemed to me there could be none worse because of my physical timidity and hopelessness at all sports,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i goes my way and lets white folks go theirs,also i was continually enraged by the attention my parents insisted upon paying to my health even after i had emerged at the age of sixteen into a beefy broadshouldered boy who to compensate for his uncoordinated ludicrous performances in right field or on the foul line took to shooting craps in the fetid washroom of the corner candy store and rode out on saturday nights in a car full of smoking wise guys father s search in vain for that whorehouse that was rumored to be located somewhere in the state of new jersey,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i aint studying that show,the dread i felt was of course even greater than my parents surely i would awaken one morning with a murmuring heart or gasping for air or with one of my fevers of a hundred and fears caused my assault upon them to be particularly heartless even for a teenager and left them dazed and frightened of me for years thereafter,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
got a man in it can play a tune on a saw,had my worst enemy said i hope you the zuckerman i could not have been any more provoked than i was when my wellmeaning father asked if i had remembered to take my vitamin capsule or when my mother to see if a cold had made me feverish did so under the guise of giving my forehead a lingering kiss at the dinner table,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
play it like a banjo,how all that tenderness enraged me,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
you go last night,i remember that it was actually a relief to me when my sister s first husband got caught with his fist in the till of his uncle s heatingoil firm and sonia became the focus of their concern,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,and of my concern,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i going tonight if i can find where i lost that quarter,she would sometimes come back to the house to cry on my seventeenyearold shoulder after having been to visit billy in jail where he was serving a year and a day and how good it felt how uplifting it was not to be on the receiving end of the solicitude as was the case when sonia and i were children and she would entertain the little shutin by the hour and without complaint,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
you going take him with you i reckon,a few years later when i was away at rutgers billy did my parents the favor of hanging himself by a cord from the drapery rod in their bedroom,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,i doubt that he expected it would hold him knowing billy i guess he wanted the rod to give under his weight so that he might be found still breathing in a heap on the floor when my parents came back from their shopping,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
you reckon i be found anywhere with him time he start bellering,the sight of a soninlaw with a sprained ankle and a rope around his neck was supposed to move my father to volunteer to pay billy s fivethousanddollar debt to his bookie,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
what does you do when he start bellering,but the rod turned out to be stronger than billy had thought and he was strangled to death,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
i whips him,good riddance one would think,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
luster said,but no the next year sunny married in my father s phrase another one same wavy black hair same manly cleft in his chin same repellent background,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
he sat down and rolled up his overalls,johnny s weakness was not horses but hookers,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
they played in the branch,the marriage has flourished nonetheless,prediction\faulkner,prediction\roth,0
frankie was gone about a little over half an hour,each time my brotherinlaw gets caught he falls to his knees and begs sunny s forgiveness this gesture seems to go a long way with my so with our father kisses her shoes he would say closing his eyes in disgust actually kisses shoes as though that were a sign of love of anything there are four handsome wavyhaired children or were when last i saw them all in donna louis john jr and marie that name the unkindest cut of all,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
when i saw him coming he was walking fast and shaking his head,john sr,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
he went on the plane he said,builds swimming pools and brings in enough each week to be able to spend a hundred dollars on a new york call girl without feeling a thing financially speaking,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
all right,when last i saw it their summer house in the italian catskills had even more pink harem pillows in the living room than the one in scotch plains and an even grander pepper mill in both homes the silver the linens and the towels are monogrammed szr my sister s initials,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
there it was,how come,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
the consulate was closed,i used to be plagued by that question,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i had forty cents and anyhow the plane was in miami by now,how could it be that the sister of mine who had rehearsed for hours on end in our living room over and over again singing to me the songs from song of norway and the student prince until i wished i were norwegian or nobility the sister who took voice from dr,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i couldn t even send a wire,bresslenstein in his studio in north philadelphia and at fifteen was already singing because for money at weddings a sister who had the voluptuous haughty airs of a prima donna when the other little girls were still fretting over boys and acne could she wind up in a house with a harem motif mothering children taught by nuns and playing jerry vale sings italian hits on the stereo to entertain our silent parents when they come for a sunday visit,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
some mr,i used to wonder when sonia married for the second time if perhaps she were involved in a secret and mysterious religious rite if she had not deliberately set out to mortify herself so as to sound to the depths her spiritual being,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
johnson all right,leavis on matthew arnold with his breakfast or less resembled those of millions upon millions of american families,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
it was my fault,instead i imagined sonia zuckerman ruggieri in purgatorio,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i should have known better,lydia jorgenson ketterer i imagined in hell,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
well i said to frankie we might as well have a cold one,but who wouldn t have to hear those stories out of her lurid past,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
johnson bought them there were three bottles of tropical left,beside hers my own childhood frailty fevers and all seemed a version of paradise for where i had been the child served she had been the child servant the child slave roundtheclock nurse to a hypochondriacal mother and fair game to a benighted father,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
frankie felt as bad as i did,the story of incest as lydia told it was simple enough so simple that it staggered me,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i don t know how he could but he seemed to,it was simply inconceivable to me at the time that an act i associated wholly with a great work of classical drama could actually have taken place without messengers and choruses and oracles between a chicago milkman in his bloomfield farms coveralls and his sleepy little blueeyed daughter before she went off to school,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
he just kept slapping me on the back and shaking his head,yet it had,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
so there it was,once upon a time as lydia liked to begin the story early on a winter morning as he was about to set off to fetch his delivery truck her father came into her room and lay down beside her in the bed dressed for work,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i was broke,he was trembling and in tears,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i d lost five hundred and thirty dollars of the charter and tackle i couldn t replace for three hundred and fifty more,you re all i have lydia you re all daddy has,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
how some of that gang that hangs around the dock would be pleased at that i thought,i m married to a corpse then he lowered his coveralls to his ankles all because he was married to a corpse,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
it certainly would make some conchs happy,simple as that said lydia,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
and the day before i turned down three thousand dollars to land three aliens on the keys,lydia the child like lydia the adult did not scream out nor did she reach up and sink her teeth into his neck once he was over her,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
anywhere just to get them out of the country,the thought of biting into his adam s apple occurred to her but she was afraid that his screams would awaken her mother who needed her sleep,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
all right what was i going to do now,she was afraid that his screams would awaken her mother,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i couldn t bring in a load because you have to have money to buy the booze and besides there s no money in it any more,and moreover she did not want to hurt him he was her father,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
the town is flooded with it and there s nobody to buy it,jorgenson showed up for work that morning but his truck was found abandoned later in the day in the forest preserve,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
but i was damned if i was going home broke and starve a summer in that town,and where he went said lydia in mild storybook fashion nobody knew neither the invalid wife whom he had left penniless nor their horrified little child,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
besides i ve got a family,something at first made lydia believe that he had run away to the north pole though simultaneously she was convinced that he was lurking in the neighborhood ready to crush her skull with a rock if she should tell any of her little friends the dring he had done to her before disappearing,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
the clearance was paid when we came in,for years as a grown woman even after her she went to the loop at christmastime she would wonder if he might not be one of the santa clauses standing outside the department stores ringing a little bell at the shoppers,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
you usually pay the broker in advance and he enters you and clears you,in fact having decided in the december of her eighteenth year to run away from skokie with ketterer she had approached the santa claus outside goldblatt s and said to him i m getting married,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
hell i didn t even have enough money to put in gas,i don t care about you any more,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
it was a hell of a note all right,a month after lydia had divorced ketterer on grounds of physical cruelty her mother finally managed to have the stroke she had been readying herself for all her life,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
some mr,during the week the woman lay under the oxygen tent in the hospital lydia refused to visit her,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i ve got to carry something frankie i said,i told my aunts that i had put in all the hours i owed to the cause,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
he hangs around the water front and does odd jobs and is pretty deaf and drinks too much every night,if she were dying what help could i be in preventing it,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
but you never saw a fellow more loyal nor with a better heart,and if she were faking again i refused to participate and when the mother did expire at long last lydia s grief or relief or delight or guilt took the form of torpor,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i ve known him since i first started to run over there,nothing seemed worth bothering to do,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
he used to help me load plenty of times,she fed and clothed monica her sixyearold daughter but that was as far as she went,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
then when i quit handling stuff and went partyboating and broke out this swordfishing in cuba i used to see him a lot around the dock and around the café,she did not change her own clothes make the bed or wash the dishes when she opened a can to eat something she invariably discovered that she was eating the cat s tinned food,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
he seems dumb and he usually smiles instead of talking but that s because he s deaf,then she began to write on the walls with her lipstick,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
you carry anything frankie asked,the sunday after the funeral when ketterer came to take monica away for the day he found the child in a chair all dressed and ready to go and the walls of the apartment covered with questions printed in big block letters with a lipstick why not,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
sure i said,you too,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
everything on the menu is a dime except soup and that is a nickel,why should they,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
i walked as far as there with frankie and i went in and he went on,says who,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
before he went he shook me by the hand and clapped me on the back again,we will,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
don t worry he said,lydia was still at her breakfast which consisted that morning of a bowl full of kitty litter covered with urine and a sliced candle,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
me frankie much politics,oh how he loved that lydia told me,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
much business,you could just see his mind or whatever you d call what he s got in there turning over,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
much drinking,he couldn t bear you see that i had divorced him he couldn t bear that a judge in a courtroom had heard what a brute he was,prediction\hemingway,prediction\roth,0
