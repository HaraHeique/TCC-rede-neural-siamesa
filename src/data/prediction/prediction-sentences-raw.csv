all right,dont talk to me about no show
if i dont find it i cant go to the show tonight,i m afraid for you to try to turn around
mrs patterson came to the door and opened it and stood there,you can carry it
why ask me,wait right here now
then those on one side stopped at the tall white post where the soldier was,you stay down here
i think it s a surprise for mother and father and mr patterson both because mr patterson sent you some candy,i could smell the clothes flapping and the smoke blowing across the branch
find it in white folks pocket while they aint looking,i try not to worry you and dilsey
we went through the barn,luster said
is you all found it yet,i aint studying that show
the big cow and the little one were standing in the door and we could hear prince and queenie and fancy stomping inside the barn,aint got nothing against them
the stalls were all open,i ll be back in a minute
give it to me,hum up queenie
we must hurry back,then it was broader
she took the letter out of my pocket,it s froze
whoa queenie,you go last night
do you want to get that damn looney to bawling in the middle of the square,she helped me across and we went up the hill
he stopped chopping and looked at me,they played in the branch
but on the other side they went on smooth and steady but a little slower,mother said
mother said clutching me,luster said
i sat down on the bank where they were washing and the smoke blowing blue,get up queenie
he would nt know a quarter if he was to see it would he,mrs patterson came across the garden running
look at them chillen playing in the branch if you got to look at something,mrs patterson s dress was caught on the fence
they went on like the bright tops of wheels,but it s too cold to hold on today
is you all seen anything of a quarter down here,mother said
drive on tp,be enough niggers there without me
mother said,that s where they are killing the pig
i lost it somewhere,mother said
what quarter,i know you wont come
mother said clutching me,we went down the hill
do you remember when mr patterson sent you some candy last summer,aint nobody going make you go to that show
give me the letter,mr patterson climbed the fence
the roof was falling,what do you want to do about it
you reckon i be found anywhere with him time he start bellering,i saw her eyes again and i ran down the hill
aint you shamed,luster said
i could hear qucenie s feet and the bright shapes went smooth and steady on both sides the shadows of them flowing across queenie s back,there was a fence
when i saw her eyes i began to cry,caddy said
safe from what,we stopped
caddy said,help me look for it
he sat down and rolled up his overalls,it s a judgment on me
you going take him with you i reckon,you dont want your hands froze on christmas do you
you want to carry the letter,it s a christmas present
aint thought of it i reckon,you know what i think it is
all right,what does you do when he start bellering
the one i had here this morning,we can come back by there and see them
jason said,you aint got no spotted pony to ride now luster said
we cant even tell mother and father,father and quentin cant hurt you
she took the letter out of her pocket and put it in mine,you aint got no business up yonder
or they ll be froze,we got to give it to her without letting anybody see it
if it was nt so cold we d ride fancy,only i dont see why uncle maury did nt send versh
keep your hands in your pockets good now,caddy said
if there was any one here but a rummy they d tell you how square i m being with you,there it was
i was at the wheel and was working the edge of the stream opposite that old cement factory where it makes deep so close in to shore and where it makes a sort of eddy where there is always lots of bait,i yelled to johnson to let him have line but before i could say a word i saw johnson rise up in the air off the chair as though he was being derricked and him holding just for a second onto that rod and the rod bending like a bow and then the butt caught him in the belly and the whole works went overboard
don t worry he said,johnson said eddy who d waked up to have another bottle of mr
he just kept slapping me on the back and shaking his head,they re too big johnson said
frankie felt as bad as i did,what was it he said to me
we d hooked that fish and lost him without waking eddy up,he was sitting there holding onto his belly where the rod butt had hit him
before he went he shook me by the hand and clapped me on the back again,when i saw him coming he was walking fast and shaking his head
i knew he woke up dead for a drink,johnson you re just unlucky
if it isn t enjoyable why do it,johnson bought them there were three bottles of tropical left
much business,you d better drink a bottle of beer i told him
the town is flooded with it and there s nobody to buy it,he started jumping in those long lopes and every splash would be like a speed boat in a sea
so the three of us sat there in the stern and drank a highball together,i d lost five hundred and thirty dollars of the charter and tackle i couldn t replace for three hundred and fifty more
the consulate was closed,the fish was still jumping and he went on jumping until he was out of sight
the whole top fin was up out of water looking as high as a fullrigged ship and the whole scythe tail was out as he smashed at that tuna,what s this for the nigger asks me showing the coins
i m not charging you for the line,frankie came on board with me and while we sat and waited for johnson i drank a couple of cold ones out of the ice box with frankie
then when i quit handling stuff and went partyboating and broke out this swordfishing in cuba i used to see him a lot around the dock and around the café,i couldn t bring in a load because you have to have money to buy the booze and besides there s no money in it any more
a fish like that could get all your line and it not be your fault,he was a fine fish all right
put her ahead with all the machine i yelled to the nigger,it was a hell of a note all right
i bet he d go a thousand pounds,well i said to frankie we might as well have a cold one
do you know what it is,it s exceptional
we d put out a feather squid and caught four of those little tuna and the nigger put one on his hook for bait,he used to help me load plenty of times
eddy hadn t shown up all night or all day but i knew he would be around sooner or later as soon as his credit ran out,johnson he said i guess i better finish my nap
he s gone johnson said,the market fishermen can t hold them tight when they do that even with a harpoon line
i had the wheel and i kept yelling to johnson to keep his drag light and reel fast,what we have to do is use the boat to chase them so they don t take it all when they make their run
that s what you wanted to fight all by yourself i told him,you usually pay the broker in advance and he enters you and clears you
we went after him keeping him on the quarter once i d made the turn,black marlin i said
i guess that s enough for today i said,the bill was as big around as a baseball bat and slanted up and as he grabbed the bait he sliced the ocean wide open
i ve got to carry something frankie i said,i looked at him standing there tall and hollowcheeked with his mouth loose and that white stuff in the corners of his eyes and his hair all faded in the sun
i walked as far as there with frankie and i went in and he went on,i had forty cents and anyhow the plane was in miami by now
johnson all right,all right what was i going to do now
much drinking,johnson took the harness off the reel so he could put the rod across his knees because his arms got tired holding it in position all the time
when do you want to settle up mr,listen mr
what did i do wrong then johnson asked,you have to keep a light drag
you could see the hook go thirty feet in the air when he threw it,i still thought he might be out on a time or he might be there at the hotel feeling too bad to get up
he was solid purpleblack and he had an eye as big as a soup bowl,i didn t say anything to them and there they sat eddy in one of the chairs with a bottle of beer and johnson with another
everything on the menu is a dime except soup and that is a nickel,you couldn t pull out any line
all right,some mr
it trolled pretty heavy but it made a big splash in the wake,he took one out of the box and drank it
me frankie much politics,a tip i told him in spanish
it certainly would make some conchs happy,now old eddy came back astern
he s gone i told him,i bought frankie a couple at the cunard bar and i came on board feeling pretty good
it costs more now,well it s not right he said
johnson he says i m a rummy,the stripes showed clear on him
the line came taut and i saw he was headed inshore again and i could see he was turning,if you knew the way they usually charge a stranger you d know it was more than reasonable
i don t want to make any difficulties johnson said finally,i ll pay for it even though i don t see it
at six o clock i sent frankie up to the hotel to see if johnson was there,when they want it you ve got to give it to them
the hell he is i told him,frankie was gone about a little over half an hour
i never knew he had it down,we saw the plane go out and about fivethirty i was all over feeling good and was getting plenty worried
but i was getting plenty worried because he owed me eight hundred and twentyfive dollars,sure i said
it wouldn t look slack unless you knew about it because of the pull of the belly of the line in the water,i felt his drag
the sight of a soninlaw with a sprained ankle and a rope around his neck was supposed to move my father to volunteer to pay billy s fivethousanddollar debt to his bookie,what about the way it sounded to people
one reason she hated she because of that ugly name of theirs which he refused to do anything about,why their two offspring should have wasted themselves as they did why both children should have wed themselves to disaster is difficult to understand
oh what if just the genitals went and he lived a land mine were to explode beneath his boots and he was returned to a girl like sharon shatzky a blank between the legs,you too
once upon a time as lydia liked to begin the story early on a winter morning as he was about to set off to fetch his delivery truck her father came into her room and lay down beside her in the bed dressed for work,a thin austere and humorless person always meticulous in a white shirt and a tie he communicated his love for me in a precise colorless fashion that makes me ache with tenderness for him especially now that he is the bedridden one and i live in selfexile thousands of miles from his bed
my father though not so sunny in his indestructibility and constitutionally a much more solemn person than my peppy peasant of a mother was no less equal to the hardships our family endured specifically the depression my ailments and my older sister soma s inexplicable marriages twice to the sons of sicilians the first an embezzler and in the end a suicide the second honest in his business but otherwise common as dirt the yiddish word which alone seemed to carry the weight of our heartbreak and contempt prust,the dread i felt was of course even greater than my parents surely i would awaken one morning with a murmuring heart or gasping for air or with one of my fevers of a hundred and fears caused my assault upon them to be particularly heartless even for a teenager and left them dazed and frightened of me for years thereafter
zuckerman left the supply room at the end of each day bound for the office of the adjutant general where he intended to bring charges against captain clark who for all he knew held secret membership in the kkk,come on will you m a trademark her father told her i m known nationwide
use your brains,if not he proceeded
a month after lydia had divorced ketterer on grounds of physical cruelty her mother finally managed to have the stroke she had been readying herself for all her life,what is shatzky she cried sorrowfully to zuckerman but the past tense of shitzky
the sickly one in our home was me suffocating diphtheria subsequent annual respiratory infections debilitating glandular fevers mysterious visitations of allergies until puberty i spent as much time at home in my bed or under a blanket on a sofa in the living room as i did in my seat in the classroom all of which makes the disposition of my mother the mrs,beside hers my own childhood frailty fevers and all seemed a version of paradise for where i had been the child served she had been the child servant the child slave roundtheclock nurse to a hypochondriacal mother and fair game to a benighted father
simple as that said lydia,the sunday after the funeral when ketterer came to take monica away for the day he found the child in a chair all dressed and ready to go and the walls of the apartment covered with questions printed in big block letters with a lipstick why not
we will,rarely in conversation did sharon finish a sentence but rather to zuckerman s disgust glued her words together by a gummy mixture of you knows and i means and with such expressions of enthusiasm as really great really terrific and really neat last usually to describe the gang of kids she had traveled with at atlantic city when she was fifteen which to be sure had only been the summer before last
oh nathan should i make myself come on the phone,for years as a grown woman even after her she went to the loop at christmastime she would wonder if he might not be one of the santa clauses standing outside the department stores ringing a little bell at the shoppers
as the loving father had warned him looking for trouble he would find what a surprise that would be,no such thing can happen to him was what he meant because of course in warfare such things do happen they happen every day
i don t care about you any more,the next day while my mother whistled gershwin and laundered my father s shirts i would daydream in my bed about the clothing dealer and the lumberjack
the way all the other nice girls do,again he found no takers so he tried another price reduction and this time sold it here he would pause if i wished i might ask him to repeat any or all of the details
when last i saw it their summer house in the italian catskills had even more pink harem pillows in the living room than the one in scotch plains and an even grander pepper mill in both homes the silver the linens and the towels are monogrammed szr my sister s initials,i used to be plagued by that question
how all that tenderness enraged me,leavis on matthew arnold with his breakfast or less resembled those of millions upon millions of american families
if she were dying what help could i be in preventing it,years and years ago when she was still an infant in the crib all five brothers on the shatzky side had gotten together to decide to change the family name for business reasons they had decided on shadley
instead each afternoon before departing for the links over by the air base captain clark would tune up for his game by driving cotton golf balls out of his office in the direction of the cubicle occupied by the clerktypist manqué,almost as stirring as when she crawled to him across the length of her parents living room that night her eyes leveled on his exposed member and her tongue out and moving
or so it seemed until that day they issued him his mi rifle and he found he needed everyone he had,i ain t ashamed he told the other went on from there he informed his daughter to become the biggest success of them all
nothing seemed worth bothering to do,the marriage has flourished nonetheless
lay off,though pain would come to zuckerman in the form of estrangement mortification fierce and unremitting opposition antagonists who were not respectable deans or loving fathers or dimwitted officers in the army quartermaster corps oh yes pain would enter his life soon enough and not entirely without invitation
she would sometimes come back to the house to cry on my seventeenyearold shoulder after having been to visit billy in jail where he was serving a year and a day and how good it felt how uplifting it was not to be on the receiving end of the solicitude as was the case when sonia and i were children and she would entertain the little shutin by the hour and without complaint,lucky zuckerman
which wasn t quite over yet,her cousin cindy was cindy shadley her cousin ruthie was ruthie alone of the girls in the family was still shatzky
if the cost of cutting open a and so on,why should they
and if she were faking again i refused to participate and when the mother did expire at long last lydia s grief or relief or delight or guilt took the form of torpor,lydia ketterer was a divorced woman five years my senior and mother of a tenyearold girl who lived with lydia s former husband and his second wife in a new suburban housing development south of chicago
i have no nostalgia for that childhood of illness none at all,in fact having decided in the december of her eighteenth year to run away from skokie with ketterer she had approached the santa claus outside goldblatt s and said to him i m getting married
nor is it what is meant in literature or even in life for that matter by suffering or pain,casebook fantasies of retribution
oh when she started talking she could bury you in boredom,did the man who bought it realize it was cut in last year s style
it was not it turned out a complicated sort of rebellion sharon was engaged in but then she wasn t a complicated girl,it was simply inconceivable to me at the time that an act i associated wholly with a great work of classical drama could actually have taken place without messengers and choruses and oracles between a chicago milkman in his bloomfield farms coveralls and his sleepy little blueeyed daughter before she went off to school
oh how he loved that lydia told me,when i was the sickly feverish patient i felt something more like mystification as though he were a kind of talking electrical toy come to play with me promptly each evening at six
a few years later when i was away at rutgers billy did my parents the favor of hanging himself by a cord from the drapery rod in their bedroom,zuckerman could type only with his index fingers and he knew nothing about filing or making out forms but fortunately for him the captain in charge of the supply room to which he was assigned was so pleased to have a jew around to that too has been known to he was willing to make do with an inept assistant
lydia was still at her breakfast which consisted that morning of a bowl full of kitty litter covered with urine and a sliced candle,the thought of biting into his adam s apple occurred to her but she was afraid that his screams would awaken her mother who needed her sleep
also i was continually enraged by the attention my parents insisted upon paying to my health even after i had emerged at the age of sixteen into a beefy broadshouldered boy who to compensate for his uncoordinated ludicrous performances in right field or on the foul line took to shooting craps in the fetid washroom of the corner candy store and rode out on saturday nights in a car full of smoking wise guys father s search in vain for that whorehouse that was rumored to be located somewhere in the state of new jersey,oh each time a golf ball caromed softly off his flesh how he seethed with isn t however as private zuckerman well knew the same as running with blood
he did not think that was intelligent of me and he was right,invited to a fancy ball
the zipper king was as awful as ways it was worse,he entered the army after their feverish daredevil month together secretly relieved at having left behind him seemingly as he had found her al and minna s fivefoot nineinch baby girl she was a tantalizing slave and an extraordinary lay but hardly a soul mate for someone who felt as he did about great writers and great books
but no the next year sunny married in my father s phrase another one same wavy black hair same manly cleft in his chin same repellent background,if her behavior continued to exceed understanding it was now because it seemed so pathetically transparent
oh nathan i m touching my cunt i m touching my cunt and making believe it s you,unfortunate because he wonders if that isn t more the measure of the man than of the misfortune
he would begin to the vanity and the ignorance to be sure but above all for the contradictions the stinging tongue and the tender hide the spiritual aspirations and the lewd desires the softy boyish needs and the manly the magisterial ambitions,the story of zuckerman s suffering calls for an approach far more serious than that which seems appropriate to the tale of his easeful salad days
it had been a life of little but punishment humiliation betrayal and defeat and it was to this that i was drawn against all my misgivings,the truth was that when she was not putting on a threering circus for him sharon was pretty much of a bore to zuckerman
not kwat replied his superior all concentration not and would continue to swat them out through the open door of his office until at last he d found the mark,but who wouldn t have to hear those stories out of her lurid past
her gait in particular displeased me mannish awkward it took on a kind of rolling quality when she tried to move quickly and in my mind associated with images of cowhands and merchant seamen,you ll get married and why i ll cry at the wedding is out of happiness that i won t have to hear any more of this name and so on in this vein for the five tedious years of sharon s adolescence
had my worst enemy said i hope you the zuckerman i could not have been any more provoked than i was when my wellmeaning father asked if i had remembered to take my vitamin capsule or when my mother to see if a cold had made me feverish did so under the guise of giving my forehead a lingering kiss at the dinner table,that is only irrational guilt over sharon and the zucchini is only fear of punishment for buggering the daughter right under the father s nose
but that is another story and one whose luridness makes the smalltime southern jewbaiter lofting cotton golf balls toward his nose makes even seventeenyearold sharon shatzky performing for him on a gourd like a pigalle whore at an exhibition seem as much a part of his idyllic and innocent youth as that afternoon he once spent sipping tea and eating watercress in caroline benson s garden,you ll get one all you know how
yes over the next decade of his life he was to learn all that his father might have wished dale carnegie to teach him about humility and then some,john sr
i love your prick the girl wept into the phone,and then after the eight weeks of infantry training followed by eight more at mp school he was assigned as a clerktypist to a quartermaster unit at fort campbell in the southwestern corner of kentucky sixty miles east of paducah eight thousand east of the land mines
i want to be your whore she whispered to him without prompting too while on the back terrace her mother told his mother how adorable sharon looked in the winter coat they d bought for her that afternoon,to her she would say disparagingly of some silly neighbor the beall and endall is to put on a silver fox and go gallivanting with the hoi polloi not until i got to college and misused the word myself did i learn that what my mother took to mean the because hoi polloi sounded like another of her disdainful expressions for people who put on airs the hoitytoity referred to the masses
if and when she did get a joke of his she would sigh and roll her eyes toward heaven as though his subtleties were on a par with her father who had been the h l mencken of bass college,to whom had the haberdasher finally sold the overcoat
my father was a bookkeeper,during their marriage whenever lydia dared to criticize or question her husband s judgment he would lift her from the massive man twice her weight and a foot heave her against the nearest wall in the months following the divorce he abused her through her child who was then six and in lydia s custody and when lydia broke down ketterer took the child to live with him and subsequently after lydia had been released from the hospital and was back in her apartment refused to return the little girl
i m married to a corpse then he lowered his coveralls to his ankles all because he was married to a corpse,after the father fled lydia had been taken to be raised in the home of two spinster aunts in skokie until she ran off with ketterer at the age of eighteen she and her mother shared a room at the rear of this haven whose heroes were the aviator lindbergh the senator bilbo the cleric coughlin and the patriot gerald l k smith
we went around the barn,johnson eddy said
caddy said,i can still feel him pull johnson said
got a man in it can play a tune on a saw,it had to break
what you want to do then,johnson he says you re just unlucky
mrs patterson was looking out the window,he s right and he s reasonable eddy told him
you tp,eddy was a good man on a boat once before he got to be a rummy but he isn t any good now
you tp,he s hooked good
i got to turn around some how,but you never saw a fellow more loyal nor with a better heart
i bet you all be right there when that tent open,he hangs around the water front and does odd jobs and is pretty deaf and drinks too much every night
caddy said,well mr
how come you cant behave yourself like folks,he d screwed the drag tight and when the fish struck it lifted johnson right out of the chair and he couldn t hold it
give it to me she said give it to me,nothing i said
what do you want to go that way for,he went on the plane he said
luster said,i ll give you a list of what i spent and i ll deduct what grub there is left
that means how cold it is,if he d had the harness on it would have taken him along too
he think he want to go up yonder where they knocking that hall,but i was damned if i was going home broke and starve a summer in that town
was last night,you hit the nail on the head there
then we could seethe branch where the smoke was blowing,what s the matter he said
cant you turn here,the next day i worked around her all morning changing the oil in her base and one thing and another
luster said,johnson eddy said
caddy said,and the day before i turned down three thousand dollars to land three aliens on the keys
them folks hit you sho,still i figured he had been out late and probably didn t get up till around noon
mother said,then once twice he came out stiff as a post the whole length of him jumping straight toward us throwing the water high each time he landed
i d feel safer if you would,there s sixteen with today and a day each way makes eighteen
i bet you be there,you have to reel that line in first i told him
i aint studying no quarter,you owe two hundred and ninetyfive dollars for that rod and reel and line i told johnson
they were washing down at the branch,i cut out the engine and went back to the stern
luster said,i didn t like to see him hold the rod that way but i hated to be crabbing at him all the time
he hit queenie with the whip,but i knew
the shapes flowed on,you know perfume a couple of fans and three of those high combs
what you got against white folks,you carry anything frankie asked
nigger s money good as white folks i reckon,johnson what do you say we go out tonight then he went back and laid down again
hum up there,if he was in it he d be killed
he took the letter,i ll go to the bank in the morning johnson said
versh wont tell,if a fish broke it and it wasn t your fault that would be something else
aint yet,the banks were open until threethirty
jason said,maybe i am
jason said,well we hooked another one around noon and he jumped off
only i got to find that one,you re through
luster said plenty more where that one come ftom,about four o clock when we re coming back close in to shore against the stream it going like a mill race us with the sun at our backs the biggest black marlin i ever saw in my life hit johnson s bait
mother said,the line was slack
where d you get a quarter boy,he was a fine fish bright silver now barred with purple and as big around as a log
i dont aim to stop you do i was that all you wanted with me just to tell me that,i told the nigger to head her for the morro
we going down to the branch,he was a nigger that never thought much of any of us
what he want to do,now maybe you re lucky with women
jason said,that s pretty good mr
stop it mother,if you don t give them line when they hook up like that they break it
we re going to the cemetery,still fishing
luster said,now he ll make his run i said
you idiot mrs patterson said i told him never to send you alone again,when i finished i stopped in at donovan s and had a beer and talked with the old man and then walked back to the san francisco docks stopping in at three or four places for a beer on the way
she climbed the fence with the letter in her hand and went through the brown rattling flowers,only a short time after having been shipped by providential last big dose as it turned out of beginner s the rural american southland instead of the korean slaughter adversity was to catch up with the young conquistador
uncle maury is going to surprise mrs patterson with it,of course the contrast to my own background of familial devotion and solidarity was overwhelming whereas lydia remembered a thousand and one nights of rubbing sloan s liniment into her mother s back i could not remember a single hour of my childhood when my mother was incapable of performing the rites of her office
we came to the branch,so much for the class struggle as a burning issue in my house or social resentment or ambitiousness as a motive for action
what do you want,but oh christ was he mad
luster said,only her father of the five refused to make the improvement
i goes my way and lets white folks go theirs,good sensible people
mrs patterson leaned across the fence reaching her hand,if he wore it to a restaurant would people laugh
jason said,how come
the ones on thc other side began again bright and fast and smooth like when caddy says we are going to sleep,no matter what they may say about me now sexual desire had nothing to do with it
mother said,but what
i got my own business to tend to,my mother thought the questions i raised about these puzzles were cute and was glad they gave me something to think about when she was occupied with housework and could not take the time to play go fish or checkers my father on the other hand was disheartened to find me intrigued by fantastic and irrelevant details of geography and personality and intention instead of the simple beauty of the arithmetical solution
i bet you was there last night,dignity i was to understand had nothing to do with one s social station character conduct was everything
we began to turn,no he told himself
she was trying to climb the fence,she didn t know anything about anything
jason said,to the contrary though she was a pretty enough womansquare strong nordic head resolute blue eyes that i thought of admiringly as wintry straight wheatcolored hair worn in bangs a handsome smile an appealing openhearted short heavylegged body struck me as very nearly dwarfish in its proportions and was from first to last unremittingly distasteful
i dont have any say so,bresslenstein in his studio in north philadelphia and at fifteen was already singing because for money at weddings a sister who had the voluptuous haughty airs of a prima donna when the other little girls were still fretting over boys and acne could she wind up in a house with a harem motif mothering children taught by nuns and playing jerry vale sings italian hits on the stereo to entertain our silent parents when they come for a sunday visit
luster said,to narrate with fidelity the misfortunes of zuckerman s twenties would require deeper dredging a darker sense of irony a grave and pensive voice to replace the amused olympian point of maybe what that story requires is neither gravity nor complexity but just another author someone who would see it too for the simple fivethousandword comedy that it very well may have been
he can help look just the same,we ourselves were not elegant but surely we were not coarse
you want to get your head knocked off with one of them balls,because of his excellent memory and his quickness with figures he was considered the local savant in our neighborhood of hardworking firstgeneration jews and was the man most frequently consulted by people in trouble
time i get done over this here tub i be too tired to lift my hand to do nothing,i remember that it was actually a relief to me when my sister s first husband got caught with his fist in the till of his uncle s heatingoil firm and sonia became the focus of their concern
you ll turn us over,again he found no takers i would say aloud finding much to feel melancholy about in that idea
caddy said,southern bigot
luster said,but the rod turned out to be stronger than billy had thought and he was strangled to death
mother said,during the week the woman lay under the oxygen tent in the hospital lydia refused to visit her
luster said,builds swimming pools and brings in enough each week to be able to spend a hundred dollars on a new york call girl without feeling a thing financially speaking
play it like a banjo,and then some more
got it at the getting place,sharon hated her father
but i ll be gone too soon,he did the inept assistant continuously feared he the error in classification that had sent zuckerman to fort campbell instead of to his bloody demise in the mud behind a brothel in seoul nor did he request a replacement for him from personnel
the slanting holes were full of spinning yellow,each time my brotherinlaw gets caught he falls to his knees and begs sunny s forgiveness this gesture seems to go a long way with my so with our father kisses her shoes he would say closing his eyes in disgust actually kisses shoes as though that were a sign of love of anything there are four handsome wavyhaired children or were when last i saw them all in donna louis john jr and marie that name the unkindest cut of all
come on here,but since actually zuckerman was not even supposed to be in kentucky but had been allocated for destruction in korea and might wind up there yet if he gave clark any trouble he invariably saw fit to suppress his indignation and proceed on over to the mess hall for dinner and then on to the post library to continue to read his way through the bloomsbury group with time out every hour or so for another look at the day s bawdy letter from the teenage debauchee he hadn t been able to bring himself to relinquish quite yet
hum up queenie,coarse childish ignorant utterly lacking in that exquisiteness of feeling and refinement of spirit that he had come to admire so in the the virginia woolf whose photograph had been tacked above his desk during his last semester at bass
you wait here,i used to wonder when sonia married for the second time if perhaps she were involved in a secret and mysterious religious rite if she had not deliberately set out to mortify herself so as to sound to the depths her spiritual being
he dont know what he want to do,lydia the child like lydia the adult did not scream out nor did she reach up and sink her teeth into his neck once he was over her
the vine was dry and the wind rattled in it,especially for a girl
we went on,he was trembling and in tears
mother put her handkerchief under her veil,a clothing dealer trying to dispose of an overcoat cut in last year s style marked it down from its original price of thirty dollars to twentyfour
she broke the top of the water and held a piece of it against my face,the story of incest as lydia told it was simple enough so simple that it staggered me
caddy said,all right nathan what was the selling price if the last markdown was consistent with the others or making a chain a lumberjack has six sections of chain each consisting of four links
i whips him,how could he ever take sharon up to bass with him to visit miss benson
i just know dilsey will let something happen to quentin while i m gone,marking down he would say not unlike a recitation student announcing the tide of a poem
keep your hands in your pockets,it was not for fear of loneliness that i chose my wife or to have a helpmate or a cook or a companion in my old age and it certainly was not out of lust
mr patterson came fast with the hoc,and she had the most cockney philadelphia o he had ever heard on anyone other than a cabdriver
the floor was dry and dusty,says who
one of them was singing,his human dignity
white folks gives nigger money because know first white man comes along with a band going to get it all back so nigger can go to work for some more,and what did last year s style look like anyway
i going tonight if i can find where i lost that quarter,i told my aunts that i had put in all the hours i owed to the cause
he had his hands in his pockets and a pencil behind his ear,oh why won t he change it
you all going to the show tonight,if ever a mother and father were not responsible for the foolishness of their children it was mine
it fell through this here hole in my pocket,she wanted a father with a name that wasn t either a joke or an outright lie she wanted a real name and she warned him some day when she was old enough she would hire a lawyer and go down to the county courthouse and get one
you sit down here and play with your jimson weed,something at first made lydia believe that he had run away to the north pole though simultaneously she was convinced that he was lurking in the neighborhood ready to crush her skull with a rock if she should tell any of her little friends the dring he had done to her before disappearing
johnson eddy said,he was the second man nearly to destroy her the first lydia s father had seduced her when she was twelve
listen mr,his idea of amusing me was to teach me to solve the sort of arithmetical puzzles at which he himself was a whiz
there isn t any line will hold them,watching her run to meet me on some chicago we had become would positively recoil even at a distance at the prospect of holding that body against me at the idea that voluntarily i had made her mine
you see it don t you cap,you re all i have lydia you re all daddy has
i was broke,she was afraid that his screams would awaken her mother
donovan told me he d been in there the night before a little while with johnson and eddy had been setting them up on credit,and moreover she did not want to hurt him he was her father
he seems dumb and he usually smiles instead of talking but that s because he s deaf,what about the sheer ugliness of that name
he swallowed the bait and they pulled his stomach out and he came to the top and died,in early adolescence i underwent daily schoolyard humiliation at the time it seemed to me there could be none worse because of my physical timidity and hopelessness at all sports
so there it was,and where he went said lydia in mild storybook fashion nobody knew neither the invalid wife whom he had left penniless nor their horrified little child
all of a sudden i see his rod jerk and the line go slack,i doubt that he expected it would hold him knowing billy i guess he wanted the rod to give under his weight so that he might be found still breathing in a heap on the floor when my parents came back from their shopping
but it was a sloppy way to fish,good riddance one would think
he had it screwed down tight,his human rights
the rod cost me fortyfive,on target sir said he with a smile
i d left word at the dock for them to tell him to go on board and wait for me but they said he hadn t come,his religion
he was huge,whose editorials on the shortcomings of the administration and the student body miss benson had likened in their savage wit to jonathan swift
i don t know how he could but he seemed to,then she began to write on the walls with her lipstick
besides with the drag off line would go out so there wasn t any danger,zuckerbird the postman called more impressive
i know it seems like a lot of money but it was a lot of money when i bought the tackle too,stop having such thoughts
i was thinking to myself that this johnson had fished fifteen days finally he hooks into a fish a fisherman would give a year to tie into he loses him he loses my heavy tackle he makes a fool of himself and he sits there perfectly content drinking with a rummy,that my sister s first husband and my only wife should both have taken their own lives would seem to suggest something about our common upbringing
when i came on board i had just forty cents left,who s he honey well the truth was that by the time she was fifteen she couldn t bear that he called himself the zipper king either
johnson i asked him,i still remember how charged for me was that word takers could it have been the lumberjack with the six sections of chain who in his rustic innocence had bought the overcoat cut in last year s style
the reel cost two hundred and fifty dollars,if indeed she ever had been indisposed it seemed not even to interfere with her famous whistling that continuous medley of show tunes she chirped melodiously away at through her day of housework and family chores
i tell you mr,zuckerman did his best to look unperturbed when the golf balls glanced off his shirt
hell i didn t even have enough money to put in gas,for in severity and duration in sheer painfulness it would be like nothing he had known at home in school or in the service nor would it be like anything he had imagined while contemplating the harrowed soulful face of virginia woolf or while writing his a honors paper on the undercurrent of agony in her novels
reel on him i said,instead i imagined sonia zuckerman ruggieri in purgatorio
besides i ve got a family,the mother had been bedridden since lydia s birth a victim it would seem of nothing more than lumbago but perpetually weak unto dying
but i tell you he s right,how could it be that the sister of mine who had rehearsed for hours on end in our living room over and over again singing to me the songs from song of norway and the student prince until i wished i were norwegian or nobility the sister who took voice from dr
i couldn t even send a wire,she fed and clothed monica her sixyearold daughter but that was as far as she went
i was plenty sore,i have no theories
i should have known better,he couldn t bear you see that i had divorced him he couldn t bear that a judge in a courtroom had heard what a brute he was
much obliged for the beer sir some eddy,my mother used to laugh and make cracks about the ladies around who had secret dreams of mink coats and miami beach vacations
at noon i went uptown and ate at a chink place where you get a good meal for forty cents and then i bought some things to take home to my wife and our three girls,jorgenson showed up for work that morning but his truck was found abandoned later in the day in the forest preserve
i ve known him since i first started to run over there,beneficiary of one of those administrative errors by which doomed men are suddenly pardoned and the happygolucky are overnight earmarked for death
it was my fault,and why suddenly did he need an overcoat
he s still jumping you could see him out a half a mile still throwing spouts of water,yet it had
then i saw a splash like a depth bomb and the sword and eye and open lowerjaw and huge purpleblack head of a black marlin,a strong character not a big bankroll was to them the evidence of one s worth
how some of that gang that hangs around the dock would be pleased at that i thought,failing to make a sale he reduced the price still further to nineteen dollars and twenty cents
so he wouldn t have to pay,johnny s weakness was not horses but hookers
we waited and i began to wonder about johnson not showing up,lydia jorgenson ketterer i imagined in hell
some mr,and of my concern
he s gone said johnson,she did not pronounce the g in length nor did she aspirate the h in when or why nor would she have in whale had the conversation ever turned to melville
anywhere just to get them out of the country,she did not change her own clothes make the bed or wash the dishes when she opened a can to eat something she invariably discovered that she was eating the cat s tinned food
he d had the butt under one leg and the rod across his lap,these things also happen every day
the clearance was paid when we came in,what if she started telling miss benson those pointless and interminable anecdotes about herself and her highschool friends
if he hooks up i ll chase him,what am i supposed to become all of a sudden al the zipper king shadley
i kept waiting and waiting until it was late,by whom
keep your drag light,i miss your prick so much
because his hands got tired holding the spool of the reel against the drag of the big bait he screwed the drag down when i wasn t looking,you could just see his mind or whatever you d call what he s got in there turning over
then he came out again and smashed the water white and i could see he was hooked in the side of the mouth,as if sharon protested to zuckerman that proved anything
the fish didn t make any difference to him,unfortunately the author of this story having himself experienced a similar misfortune at about the same age does not have it in him even yet midway through his thirties to tell it briefly or to find it funny
